# Aerofoil Flow Field Prediction with CNN

Predict aerofoil flow fields using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) velocity data.

## Overview
This project enhances accuracy in flow field reconstruction, providing an efficient method for aerodynamic analysis.

## Data
Velocity vectors from PIV experiments are transformed into contour plots, offering a visual representation of flow patterns.

## Model
The CNN architecture extracts spatial features, trained with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss and Adam optimizer.

## Results
Highly accurate predictions are demonstrated through contour plots, showcasing the model's effectiveness in capturing complex aerodynamic phenomena.

## Usage
Explore the code in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.
